      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const team = players;
      team[3] = 'lux';
      console.log(players, team); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'lux'] 陣列的複製是採用淺拷貝的方式

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // 以下這些方法可以深拷貝陣列
      const team2 = players.splice();
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      const team4 = [...players];
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      // 物件一樣是使用淺拷貝方式
      const captain = person;
      captain.age = 99;
      console.log(person.age, captain.age); // 99 99

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // 使用Obj.assign可以對原物件進行深拷貝，但是只能拷貝到第一層，如果是多層結構內部的屬性依舊會被改變
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      const cap3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
      const cap4 = { ...person };

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
